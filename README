You should use a venv, the following explains how to go about making one and setting up the environment.

to make .venv use:
python3 -m venv .venv

to use .venv use:
source .venv/bin/activate

then import all the needed imports:
    python3 -m pip install
    * scikit-learn
    * pandas
    * matplotlib

to exit venv use:
deactivate


To work on the project we will have a seperate main, dev, and self branches

main is what we will be presenting

dev is what will be our cumulative work

self branch will be your working branch, name it after your uga id (ie bgw88439 for me)

initially you will use the following:

git checkout origin/dev
git branch bgw88439
git checkout bgw88439
git add .
git status
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin bgw88439

from that point on you can get other peoples work by using:
git fetch

from that point you can push your work using:
git push

When you are done with your branches work, you can submit a PR (pull request),
in which someone will review your work and merge it
do this by going into github, going to pull requests,
set base to dev and compare to your self branch
then submit the PR in which someone will review it and then merge it with dev
